For some reason I was not able to find the code easily and once I was I wanted to rehost it if someone else needed it.  I tried to search for Josh Smith but was not able to find it.

This is a primer to MVVM and is not the 'best way' to do MVVM.  Just one way to do it.  Essentially you can load up your ViewModel to your View in 
1. Code behind
2. Inline in the xaml to a reference to your ViewModel
3. In the resource dictionary to have many references of views to their respective view models. 

This main course follow method 3 and is just a primer to get your started on MVVM in and of itself.
